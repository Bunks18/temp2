You only need to run these commands once when setting up the repository

git init - creates an connection to github

git remote add origin [repo name] - tell github where you want to store your code

Run these commands everytime you want to push code

git status - check the difference btw local and github

git add . - add everything on my local that is untracked . === all files

git commit -m "commit message" - add a message to the commit

git push origin master - actually send the code up to github
